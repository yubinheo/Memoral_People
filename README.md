# Memoral People

Memorial People is a website developed with the aim of fostering gratitude   
for many meritorious people who sacrificed themselves for Korea.      

The "Sewol incident", which has long been mentioned to many,   
has given us a lot of enlightenment.   
   
It's a site that was created to express our gratitude to the victims who have experienced such things.
      
      
It was developed using Node.js, and the site has a memorial function using media and writing.
